*Seven questions were dealt with in this work.
*What is that status of truth? 
Gibbs states that truth is solely that which is created by power, irrespective of if those "truths" are "real". Real truth is impossible (simplified).
* Is there any such thing as objective history Vs. Interrpretation? 
Yes, certain things can trivially be discovered to be true, but all else is interpretation. 
Furthermore, there is no "center" position to view these; all "centers" are arbitrary.
* Bias is inescapable; You have to have objecitvity to define bias, bias is limited to certain paradigms, and these paradigms are not correct in their entirety.
* Empathy is impossible due to distance from past, interpretation and circumstances relative to author...
Because the process of writing history precludes it, and because you're reading through the lens of another.
Also discussion about why you attempt it, rejection of conventional academia, etc.
* Primary and secondary sources ultimately fall into the flaw of "Evidence" "Truth" and such things already espoused. 
A more correct view is that the past left traces, these traces exist, and when a historian pulls them together to make a point, they become evidence.
Thus evidence cannot constrain a historians "free-play" writing, due to how organizing them favors a conclusion (simplified).
* Historians cannot determine cause and effect because there is a infinite recursion. More rejection of conventional academia.
* The entire Art Vs. Science debate is rooted in historical effects that are highly passe.
