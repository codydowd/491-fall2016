**Rethinking History Chapter 1 Questions**

1. Will it ever be possible to create an un-biased history?
2. Is history just multiple copies of all the histories that came before? Just copies of copies?
3. What is considered good history? Is it the history that the majority agrees on? OR the most complete and unbiased history?
4. What can history do to protect itself from ideological history and propoganda history? Can it ever truly be free from ideological influence? 
5. Can history rely on scientific fact rather than unreachable truths to create an unbiased history? Or are we stuck forever with conjecture and what ifs?
