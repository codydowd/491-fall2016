Jenkins in this chapter, discusses the problems that the field of history must come to terms with, in order to commit to their field honestly. He also poses questions and answers them, in regards to the obstacles they create within history:

1.	Truth, is a created concept, that is a self-referencing term that can be used to censor interpretations. Jenkins believes truth can never be truly grasped by historians.
2.	It is impossible to empathize with those who lived in the past, because we cannot possibly understand their situations. It is impossible to understand their life story, because we cannot reproduce their worldview within us. 
3.	A group of “facts” is nothing more than a consensus on what historians believe truly happened in the past, and this consensus is an aspect of the ability of the powerful to create facts and truth. 
4.	There will always be bias whenever we attempt to assign meaning to a group of “facts”. This interpretation by historians brings doubt to whether the past is truly represented within their interpretation. 
5.	The sources of history can change depending on the intended use of the source in question. A primary source can also be a secondary source, depending on the situation.
