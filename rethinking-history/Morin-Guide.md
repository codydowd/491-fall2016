+How do the epistemological issues surrounding history contribute to it's status as an "Art" or "Science? 
Does this make it more or less scientific?
+To what degree is Jenkin's statement about the past being unable to be "checked against" actually true? 
Can we ever "check" historical statements? Are the methods of doing so significant or reliable to the discussion?
+What influences might Jenkins time period have had on his statements about Idealogy, perspective, and "pull"? 
For instance, he states that history as told by "Black Marxist-Feminists" is not present in any undergraduate course-is that an artifact of the times, in a meta-analysis? 
And is this question significant for his overall point, or only the specific example?
+To what degree is Jenkins statement on the practice of history true historically? 
That is, should we consider his statements solely in the present day, or is he making a point that can extend to works written in the past?
+Is his specific definition of history significant? Is defining history significant at all?
