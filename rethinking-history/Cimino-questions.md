1.	Jenkins seems to argue that there is no such thing as truth, it is as he says a ‘useful fiction’, would you agree that he is claiming a truth within his argument? In other words, do you think Jenkins is claiming it is true that one truth does not exist? Why or why not? If so, how may this weaken his argument? 

2.	In the Bias section of chapter two Jenkins discusses that empathy is hard in history because we cannot fully relate to a people that lived in a different era. Would it be safe to say there could be natural tendencies that would create same feelings, i.e. death of a loved one etc.? Or are people in different eras drastically different? Would there be a way to approach the past without empathy? If so, how?

3.	On Primary and Secondary Sources Jenkins says on p. 58, “If we do not have these ideas, if we are freed from the desire for certainty...then we are free to see history as an amalgam of those epistemological, methodological, ideological and practical concerns I have outlined.” Would you agree that it seems to be natural for people to search for certainties? How would we be able to separate that natural tendency from achieving the freedom that Jenkins discusses? And if we did achieve that, how would history be viewed differently?
