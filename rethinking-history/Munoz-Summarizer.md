<b> RETHINKING HISTORY </b> <br> First reading 6-32 <br>

1.	<b>“The past and history float free of each other” (Jenkins 7). </b><br>
   a.	Here the author separates what is known as the past (virtually everything that happened everywhere forever before right now) and history (which is basically historiography, the thing we are studying in class or historians writings). This distinction between the two set up the rest of his prose, and it is essential in to our class’s purposes in understanding what we are actually studying. The author then moves into making an argument into why the past/history distinctions are relevant to our conversation.<br> 
     i.	“The past [is] for all that has gone on before everywhere” (7). “Historiography referring here to the writing of historians” (7).<br>
     ii.	“…Actually, at this stage … your ‘reading’ of the English past [is] not basically [Elton’s] reading (or anyone’s) of it” (9).<br>
     iii.	There exists a “hidden history”, in which “groups, people(s), classes, have been/are omitted” (9).<br>
2.	<b>Everyone “interpret[s] the same phenomenon differently” (Jenkins 11). </b><br>
   a.	If this wasn’t already obvious enough to anyone with a critical thinking skillset. But for our purposes this is extremely important because all we know about history is what we read, as made by the distinction from Jenkins already. Interpretations of events are different, so how can there be one history? Or one true history?
3.	<b>“Epistemology … refers to the philosophical area of theories of knowledge. This area is concerned with how we know anything” (Jenkins 12).</b><br>
   a.	So, history is governed by not just what happened in the past, but all of these schools of thought and theory. History embodies a lot of complicated discourse, so knowing (to be frank) what the hell is going on and what is being said and why is important to reading anything, especially history.
4.	<b>Epistemological is fragile by nature, “allow[ing] for historians’ readings to be multifarious” (Jenkins 13).</b> And Jenkins gives us reasons why:<br>
   a.	“No historian can cover … the totality of past events because their ‘content’ is virtually limitless” (13).<br>
   b.	“No account can re-cover the past as it was because the past was not an account but [an] event” (13).<br>
   c.	“History relies on someone else’s eyes and voice” (14).<br>
   d.	“… We know more abot the past than the people who lived in it” (15).<br>
5.	<b>The “truer past” (Jenkins 17). – The “original thesis” (27). – “Who is history for” (22).</b><br>
   a.	With all of the above in mind, it is impossible to say what the right direction for the truest past is. And this affects not only how historians write things but how we read them as students. Jenkins makes a strong comment on how “no two readings are ever the same”, and he uses a strong example in the text (29).<br>
6.	<b>“If it is all relative what is the point?” (Jenkins 30).</b><br>
   a.	He wraps up his musings with helping the broad minded student: the student that might fall into a sort of Nihilistic spiral after reading the prose. Jenkins defines writing and studying history as “liberating” and that “knowledge is related to power”, ultimately leading to some sort of understanding in “how things operate” (30).
