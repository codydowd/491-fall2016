1. On page 56, Jenkins brings up empathy, and how historians often find themselves in a difficult situation when trying to imagine what others from the past thought and were going through, and that the standard way of dealing with this problem is by using the human nature argument, which states that “all people are and always have been basically the same.” Therefore, my question is, **what is the standard definition of “human nature”? Is it a good idea to assume that all humans have acted/will act the same, regardless of what era, where, and how they grew up?**

2. Throughout chapters one and two, Jenkins has discussed the importance of understanding that history is left up to interpretation, and that history builds upon itself. Historians have and will continue to develop their own opinions and perspectives based off of the work of others. That being said, **is it possible to ever completely trust a source or piece of evidence as being the truth, given that the subject of history is so heavily based upon interpretation, even if the narrator (historian) is trying to remain objective with their own work?**  

3. On page 63, Jenkins states that when answering a historical-based question, we often copy the ideas of others who have also had to answer the same question and have done extensive research to do so. If this is the case, **how do we differentiate our own ideas from the ideas of others?**
